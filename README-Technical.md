# Portfolio in Data Analysis and Data Science

This repository curates a small set of projects that best represent my skills as a Data Analyst and aspiring Data Scientist. It brings together work from a personal analytics project and my Bachelors and Masters dissertations, with a focus on clear problem statements, reproducible workflows, and actionable insights.

## Featured Projects

### 1. Markdown Notes – Personal Analytics Project

**Repo:** [Markdown-Notes-Processing-and-Analysis](https://github.com/JackEdwardAuty/Markdown-Notes-Processing-and-Analysis)

A personal end‑to‑end analytics project on my own Obsidian note vault. The goal is to extract and analyse structured data (medication, meals, sleep and other tracked events) from semi‑structured Markdown daily notes.

**Highlights**

- Built Python scripts to parse and transform Markdown templates into analysis‑ready tables (dates, times, categories, metrics).
- Created visualisations and dashboards in Excel / Tableau / Power BI to explore relationships between routines, medications, and sleep or wellbeing measures.
- Demonstrates practical data‑wrangling on real, messy text; feature engineering; and communication of insights in a way that non‑technical people can understand.

### 2. Masters Project – Curriculum Learning for Reinforcement Learning

**Repo:** [Masters-Project-Exploring-Curriculum-Learning-to-Improve-Reinforcement-Learning](https://github.com/JackEdwardAuty/Masters-Project-Exploring-Curriculum-Learning-to-Improve-Reinforcement-Learning)

A research‑oriented project exploring how **curriculum learning** can improve reinforcement learning agents, by structuring tasks in order of increasing complexity.

**Highlights**

- Implemented and evaluated reinforcement learning agents under different curriculum strategies, using Python and deep RL libraries.
- Designed experiments, collected results, and analysed learning curves and performance metrics to understand when curricula help or hurt training.
- Shows ability to manage complex codebases, design controlled experiments, and interpret model behaviour – skills that transfer directly to A/B testing and model evaluation in industry.

### 3. Bachelors Project – Early Prediction of Sepsis from Clinical Data

**Repo:** [Bachelors-Project-Early-Prediction-of-Sepsis-from-Clinical-Data](https://github.com/JackEdwardAuty/Bachelors-Project-Early-Prediction-of-Sepsis-from-Clinical-Data)

A machine‑learning pipeline for early prediction of sepsis from ICU time‑series data, inspired by open sepsis‑prediction challenges and literature.

**Highlights**

- Built an end‑to‑end workflow: data loading and preprocessing, windowed feature creation, model training (e.g. tree‑based or gradient‑boosted models), and evaluation.  
- Used metrics such as ROC AUC and precision–recall to assess early‑warning performance on highly imbalanced clinical data.  
- Includes UML and sequence diagrams to document the architecture (DataLoader → ModelTrainer → Evaluator) and to communicate clearly with clinical or non‑technical stakeholders.

## Skills Demonstrated

Across these projects, this portfolio shows:

- Data **wrangling and cleaning** in Python (pandas, custom parsers for ~~Markdown~~, time‑series preprocessing).
- Exploratory data analysis, visualisation and dashboarding (Excel / Tableau / Power BI).
- **Machine learning** for tabular and time‑series data, including evaluation on imbalanced problems (sepsis prediction).
- **Reinforcement learning** and curriculum design from the Masters project.
- Communication of complex ideas via diagrams, notebooks, and written reports suitable for both technical and non‑technical audiences.

## How to Use This Repository

- Each project has its own repository linked above, with more detailed READMEs and code.  
- This portfolio repo can simply link out to those projects, or embed selected notebooks, diagrams and slides as subfolders if a single entry‑point is preferred.
- For a quick overview in interview settings, start with the Markdown Notes project for analyst skills, then the sepsis and curriculum‑learning projects for more advanced ML and RL work.
