Slide 1
Hello everybody, my name is Jack Auty, and this is my Data Analyst Portfolio.


Slide 2 
I’m based in Doncaster and

graduated from Leeds Uni in 2021 with a 2:1 in Computer Science, specializing in AI.

Now, I’m competing a Data Skills bootcamp through Just IT.


Slide 3
Personally, I value my loved ones more than anything, and

I have a strong sense of morality which draws forth an unshakeable need to defend and advocate for others..

Evidently, I’m a major One Piece fan!

~~I am unafraid of and rather motivated by seemingly insurmountable odds.~~


Slide 4 (00:30)
Since I was young, I’ve been fascinated by exploring technology—from hosting Minecraft servers to tinkering with operating systems.

This curiosity evolved into a deep interest in data which naturally led me to explore SQL, cloud computing, data science, and machine learning during my degree.


Slide 5
As for the career gap…

Basically, I had family commitments, and was diagnosed with ADHD.

However, I'm now eager to secure a role in Data Analysis, and these projects demonstrate the necessary skillset.


Slide 6 (01:00~01:05 minutes)
For my Bachelor’s Thesis, I wanted to implement an ML project to tackle a real-world challenge.

Detecting sepsis as early as possible is vital to improving clinical outcomes.

I used a PyTorch implementation and extracted TRENDS

from ICU blood test data that allowed earlier prediction than typical methods.


Slide 7 - (01:30)

I'm sure we've all followed a curriculum before, but

do RL agents learn better when taught in this way? 

Using a TensorFlow implementation with NumPy and Matplotlib we

first challenged our agent with a simple foundational task – chasing a single-stationary target


Slide 8 (01:50)
At the final stage in our curriculum, we introduced obstacles for the agents to work around.

Eventually, this developed into a full Hide-and-Seek environment.

RL environments are used to simulate and prepare for relief scenarios and natural disasters.
~Their complexity is exponential as obstacles and additional agents are introduced.

An interesting emergent behaviour was that agents learnt to ‘surf’ on obstacles, in order to move and hide at the same time.


Slide 9 (02:15)
So, the answer to "Do AI agents learn better when taught with a curriculum?" is 

YES! 

Reinforcement Learning agents learned more quickly and efficiently when following a curriculum.


Slide 10 (02:20-02:30)
These experiences gave me ~strong analytical skills and~ a deep appreciation for the power of data.

After graduating during the pandemic, I struggled with confidence, direction and imposter syndrome especially before my diagnosis.

That’s why discovering the Data Skills Bootcamp was such an unexpected turning point.


Slide 11 (02:45)
The quality of teaching and the inspiration I drew from my cohort’s resilience, insight, and warmth — has built my confidence and reignited my drive to enter the industry.

I’m now confident in the ETL process and in Data Visualisation and Analysis.

To demonstrate this, I have built a Python project -using DataFrame and Pandas to analyse a dataset of my own.



Slide 12 (03:00)
My dataset consisted of over 1500 Markdown files tracking my medication details and wake hours through custom Obsidian templates.

I used regex to extract column headers and rows from the fileset, consolidating all 1500 files down to just 2.


Slide 13 
Then my custom transformation and normalization pipeline handled non-standard formats.

I normalized dosages, converted time ranges to midpoints, and logged outliers.

At this point, Transformation was complete, it was all ready to be loaded into Tableau for visualisation and analysis.


Slide 14 (03:45)
So, here is the final Tableau Dashboard for my Markdown Processing Project.

You’ll notice timing patterns on the left, variability in the middle, and long-term streak data on the right.

Using calculated measures I was able to isolate how my wake time impacted my Prescription adherence.


Slide 15 (04:00)
~~First looking at dose timing:~~

Most entries for Ritalin XR and Fexofenadine cluster around the morning hours, with distribution more variable as the day progresses.

This tells me that I’m most consistent early, and that I’m less likely to take my XR the later I wake up.


Slide 16 (04:15)
The box-and-whisker plot shows how the distribution varied for each medication.

While the Streak graphs show my longest streaks are when I wake between 8 and 10 AM as this shows the most consistent distribution.

~They highlight that I rarely take IR on consecutive days; since my longest IR streak was 6 days, while my longest XR streak was 29 days.~
~Also since my longest IR streak was 6 days, while my longest XR streak was 29 days, it shows that I rarely take IR on consecutive days.~
(Cut if get to 04:35)


Slide 17 (04:35)
Outside of work, I'm a dedicated tinkerer—exploring open-source software, Operating Systems and building computers.

This keeps my curiosity sharp and problem-solving skills fresh.

I'm eager to begin my career in data analysis, Im looking to apply my analytical mindset and technical expertise to deliver meaningful insights.

Thank you for listening, does anyone have any questions?
